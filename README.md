## My process

### Built with

--HTML5
--TailwindCSS
--Typescript

-This is my second project completing with tailwindcss and typescript. I learnt a lot of thing from it

## What I have learned

I had a little trouble with taking care of background transparent black for menu section and upper image appearning. I might not be able to predict the total amount color from it. But I tried my best to bring close to it as much as I can.<br>
This is the classes I used from tailwind:<br/>
```
z-20 w-full h-full invisible tablet:visible hidden bg-halfBlack top-0 left-0 bottom-0 right-0
```
<br/>
I also had time working with thumbnail update which might not be close to the image as much as possible. This is the classes I used from tailwind and I updated with typscript.<br/>
```
for parent div->w-thumbnail h-full border-orange border-4 rounded-xl
for image->thumb hover:opacity-50 w-full h-thumbailHeight cursor-pointer opacity-50
```
Check the tages below "outline and border" comment section in html file to have full idea and for typescript check under "thumbnail images sections" comment section.
